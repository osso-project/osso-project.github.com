---

Osso is the amalgamation of the hard work, research, and testing of a number of
different people. Its original development was funded by [Rocana][rocana].

Code:

* Eric Sammer ([twitter][twitter-esammer])
* Joey Echeverria ([twitter][twitter-fwiffo])
* Mark Roddy ([twitter][twitter-roddy])
* Alan Gardner ([twitter][twitter-alanctgardner])
* Matt Dailey ([twitter][twitter-mattdailey])

Osso relies heavily on the work done by the [Apache Avro][apache-avro]
community.

The Osso puppy logo and artwork is by [Andrea Bruno][li-bruno].

This website uses [Jekyll][jekyll] and a modified version of the
[Jekyll Now][jekyll-now] theme by [Barry Clark][github-bclark]. It's hosted
using [Github Pages][github-pages].

Special thanks to Don Brown, Bryce Hein, Michelle Helling, William Kulju,
Mike Tomlinson, and Thomas Wreh for all their help making Osso happen.
